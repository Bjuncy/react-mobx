# react-app
create-react-app + mobx + antd + axios 搭建一套框架

### **本项目仅为前端框架搭建练习，暂无页面详细功能代码**

## 技术栈
- 前端框架：react.js
- 页面路由：react-router-dom
- 状态管理：mobx-react
- Http客户端：Axios
- UI框架：Antd
- 数据模拟：Mock

---
## 项目结构
项目基本目录根据create-react-app自动搭建

- `config`: 配置文件，搭建时已修改好，后续一般无需修改
- `public`: 共用文件，搭建时已修改好，后续一般无需修改
- `script`: 构建文件，搭建时已修改好，后续一般无需修改
- `src`: 源码
  - `assets`：静态资源
  - `api`：api接口文件
  - `axios`：Axios 接口请求配置
  - `components`：组件文件
  - `mock`：静态资源
  - `pages`：页面文件
  - `routes`：前端路由
  - `store`：数据存值
  - `utils`：常用方法文件
- `config-overrides.js`: antd 全局自定义配置

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
